```

The null Hypothesis is that the Iron Banks trades are being flagged at 2.4%, and the observed difference in flagged trades being higher is due to random chance. The test statistic I used is the proportion of flagged trades. With the P-value being 0.00173, which is very low, I can say that likely the observed difference in flagged trades is not due to random chance and likely caused by insider trading.     

# **Question 2**

set.seed(42)  
n_sim <- 100000
n_inspections <- 50  
p_baseline <- 0.03  
observed_proportion <- 8 / n_inspections

data_sim <- do(n_sim) * rflip(n_inspections, prob = p_baseline)
data_sim$proportion <- data_sim$heads / n_inspections  


p_value <- mean(data_sim$proportion >= observed_proportion)

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = "lightblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +

```
The null hypothesis is that the health code violations at Gourmet Bites occur at the same 3% rate as other restaurants, and the observed higher proportion of violations is due to random chance. The test statistic used is the proportion of inspections that resulted in health code violations. The p-value calculated is 0.00012, which is extremely low. Since the p-value is much lower than 0.05, it suggests that the observed violation rate at Gourmet Bites is unlikely to be due to random chance, indicating that the restaurant may have systemic health code issues.

cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")
```

My null hypothesis is that the distribution of jurors on the panel is not significantly different from the countyâ€™s population proportions, meaning any differences observed are due to random chance not than racial bias. The test statistic used is the chi-square statistic, because we need to compare the expected jury composition to what was observed. I got a chi-square value of 12.42, and a p-value of 0.014.Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, showing that the jury selection differs significantly from the expected distribution. This suggests possible bias in jury selection, but other explanations, such as differences in juror availability, exemptions, or selection variations, all of these in relation to race could be factors. Further investigation could involve analyzing the selection process in more depth, reviewing  challenge patterns, and comparing results across different judges to determine if the differences are caused by this judge or part of a broader trend.

The watermarked sentence is likely sentence 6, as it has a small p-value of 0.009, suggesting that the differences in letter counts are not just due to random chance in writing, and instead caused by a LLM systematically causing these differences.
