I am investigating if gas stations charge more if they lack direct competition in sight. By simply looking at the data since there is only 101 samples, I didn't see a trend, but it is hard to tell by looking at it, so I bootstrapped. I found tthe difference in means 10,000 times, and with 95% confident I can say that the difference between gas prices for stations with no competition in sight vs. those with (No - Yes) is between 0.0075 dollars less to 0.055 dollars more. Because the interval shows that gas stations with no competition nearby's prices could be less OR more than gas station with competition, I say that the data does not support the claim, as it is inconclusive.

Here, I am investigating if income is correlated to gas prices. From personal experience, I would say that in higher income areas the gas prices are higher, but that is not based on real evidence. From looking at the data again I see no trend, but will perform a bootstrap of the correlation. Based on the bootstrap I can say with 95% confidence that the correlation between income and gas prices is somewhere between 0.20 and 0.57, with a mean correlation of 0.39. With the correlation ranging from weak to moderately strong, there is a chance that the gas stations with stoplights charge more, however I would not definintively conclude that given the wide range of the confidence interval. The evidence somewhat supports the claim but not enough to prove the claim right. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gas_prices <- gas_prices %>% mutate(Price = as.numeric(Price), Stoplight = trimws(Stoplight))

# Perform bootstrap for the difference in means (Stoplight - No Stoplight)
bootstrap_diff_stoplight <- do(10000) * {
  boot_sample <- resample(gas_prices)  # Resample the whole dataset
  mean_stoplight <- mean(~Price, data = boot_sample %>% filter(Stoplight == "Y"))
  mean_no_stoplight <- mean(~Price, data = boot_sample %>% filter(Stoplight == "N"))
  mean_stoplight - mean_no_stoplight  # Compute difference (Stoplight - No Stoplight)
}

# Compute 95% confidence interval
ci_diff <- quantile(bootstrap_diff_stoplight$result, c(0.025, 0.975))
mean_diff <- mean(bootstrap_diff_stoplight$result)

# Create a table with results
lights_table <- tibble(
  "Statistic" = c("Lower Bound (2.5%)", "Upper Bound (97.5%)", "Mean Difference"),
  "Value" = c(ci_diff[1], ci_diff[2], mean_diff)
)

# Print the table
print(lights_table)

# Create a histogram of the bootstrap sampling distribution

       x = "Mean Difference (Stoplight - No Stoplight)",
       y = "Frequency") +

```

Here, I am investigating whether gas stations at stoplights charge more for gas. From personal experience, I would assume that gas stations at stoplights might charge higher prices due to increased visibility and accessibility, but that is not based on real evidence. From looking at the data again, I do not see an obvious trend, so I performed a bootstrap analysis of the difference in mean gas prices, stoplight vs no stoplight. Based on the bootstrap, I can say with 95% confidence that the difference in average gas prices between stations at stoplights and those not at stoplights is somewhere between -0.0384 and 0.03 Since this confidence interval includes zero, there is no strong evidence to conclude that gas stations at stoplights systematically charge more or less than those without stoplights.

Here, I am investigating whether gas stations with highway access charge more for gas. I have no conception of whether or not highway access affects gas prices. From looking at the data again, I see some variation, but no clear pattern, so I performed a bootstrap analysis of the difference in mean gas prices. Based on the bootstrap, I can say with 95% confidence that the difference in average gas prices between stations with highway access and those without is somewhere between 0.0089 and 0.0814. Since this confidence interval is entirely positive, it provides evidence that gas stations with highway access tend to charge higher prices compared to those without highway access.

  boot_sample <- resample(gas_prices)  # Resample the whole dataset

  mean_shell - mean_non_shell  # Compute difference (Shell - Non-Shell)
}

Wrapping up with the gas prices dataset, I will investigate whether Shell gas stations charge more for gas than other brands. Brand seems like a plausible factor to affect prices, if one brand is more premium than another. From looking at the data again, I do not see an obvious trend, so I performed a bootstrap analysis of the difference in mean gas prices between Shell and non-Shell stations. Based on the bootstrap, I can say with 95% confidence that the difference in average gas prices between Shell and non-Shell stations is somewhere between -0.0091 and 0.0655. Since this confidence interval includes zero, there is no strong evidence to conclude that Shell gas stations systematically charge more or less than other brands.

# **Question 3**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nbc_data <- read.csv("nbc_pilotsurvey.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


# Filter the dataset
Ed_nbc_data <- nbc_data %>%
  filter(Show == "Living with Ed" | Show == "My Name is Earl")

ed_int <- confint(t.test(Q1_Happy ~ Show, data = Ed_nbc_data))

print(ed_int)
```
I am attempting to determine if there is evidence that one show consistently produces
a higher mean Q1_Happy response among viewers. To do this I constructed a 95% confidence interval. The confidence interval shows that there's a 95% chance the difference is between -0.103 to 0.40. Because 0 is in the interval, there is no evidence to support either show causing viewers to be happier while watching. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
LA_nbc_data <- nbc_data %>%
  filter(Show %in% c("The Biggest Loser", "The Apprentice: Los Angeles"))

# Construct the 95% confidence interval
LA_int <- confint(t.test(Q1_Annoyed ~ Show, data = LA_nbc_data))

# Print the confidence interval
print(LA_int)
```

I want to determine if there is evidence that one show consistently produces a higher mean Annoyed response among viewers. To answer this question I constructed a 95% confidence interval. The confidence interval shows that there's a 95% chance the difference is between 0.0174 to 0.52 Because 0 is not in the confidence interval we can conclude that The Apprentice: Los Angeles
elicits a higher Q1 annoyed response

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
stars_nbc_data <- nbc_data %>%
  filter(Show == "Dancing with the Stars")

# Create a binary variable for Q2_Confusing (1 if response >= 4, else 0)
stars_nbc_data <- stars_nbc_data %>%
  mutate(Confusing_Binary = ifelse(Q2_Confusing >= 4, 1, 0))

# Construct the 95% confidence interval
stars_int <- confint(prop.test(sum(stars_nbc_data$Confusing_Binary), nrow(stars_nbc_data)))

# Print the confidence interval
print(stars_int)
```
I want to determine the proportion of viewers who found Dancing with the Stars confusing, as indicated by a response of 4 or 5 to the Q2_Confusing question. To answer this question, I constructed a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of viewers who found the show confusing. The confidence interval shows that there's a 95% chance the true proportion of viewers who rated Dancing with the Stars as confusing falls between 0.0445 and 0.1289. Because this interval is relatively low, we can conclude that only a small percentage of American TV watchers found Dancing with the Stars confusing.

# **Question 4**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Read the data
ebay <- read.csv("ebay.csv")

# Create the revenue ratio variable
ebay <- ebay %>%
  mutate(revenue_ratio = rev_after / rev_before)

# Compute the mean revenue ratio for treatment and control groups
mean_ratios <- ebay %>%
  group_by(adwords_pause) %>%
  summarise(mean_ratio = mean(revenue_ratio, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_ratio = sd(revenue_ratio, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n())

# Compute the difference in mean revenue ratios
diff_mean_ratio <- diff(mean_ratios$mean_ratio)

# Perform a t-test for independent samples
t_test_result <- t.test(revenue_ratio ~ adwords_pause, data = ebay)

# Extract the confidence interval
conf_interval <- t_test_result$conf.int

# Print results
print(paste("Difference in Revenue Ratio:", round(diff_mean_ratio, 4)))
print(paste("95% Confidence Interval: [", round(conf_interval[1], 4), ",", round(conf_interval[2], 4), "]"))
```

I want to determine whether EBay’s paid search advertising on Google generates additional revenue, as indicated by a lower revenue ratio in the treatment group compared to the control group. To answer this question, I made a 95% confidence interval for the difference in revenue ratios between the two groups. The confidence interval shows that there is a 95% chance that the true difference in revenue ratios between the treatment and control groups falls between 0.013 and 0.0916. Because this interval does not include zero, it suggests that the revenue ratio is higher in the treatment group, meaning that pausing paid search did not significantly reduce revenue. Since the confidence interval is entirely above zero, this evidence suggests that EBay’s paid search advertising on Google did not generate additional revenue beyond what would have occurred organically.
